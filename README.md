This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Demo : https://g-news-theta.vercel.app/

First, run the development server:

````bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev


## Getting gNews API Key

To fetch news data from gNews, you need to obtain an API key. Follow these steps:

1. Go to [gNews](https://gnews.io/docs/)
2. Click on `Get API Key`.
3. Sign up or log in to your account.
4. After logging in, you will be redirected to a page where you can see your API key.

Once you have the API key, create a new file in the root of the project named `.env.local` and add the following line:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_GNEWS_API_KEY=your_api_key
````

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
